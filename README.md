# Data Warehousing of Open Payments Dataset

This project was done for the Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence class in Northeastern University.
Open Payments collects information about financial relationships between healthcare industries and healthcare providers. And this information is made available to the public to facilitate transparency of the healthcare system. This system allows data accessors to make informed financial decisions when it comes to making purchases, providing or obtaining healthcare services.
